# Kubernetes Resources

This repository contains various Kubernetes resource configurations, intended for deployment and management of services in a Kubernetes environment. These resources are helpful for anyone looking to deploy applications, manage services, or configure cluster-wide settings on Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

To use the configurations in this repository, ensure you have the following:

- Kubernetes cluster (can be a local setup like minikube or a cloud-based solution like GKE, EKS, or AKS)
- `kubectl` configured to interact with your Kubernetes cluster

## Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each containing specific types of Kubernetes configurations. Here's what each directory typically holds:

- **Deployments**: YAML files for deploying applications.
- **Services**: YAML files to expose applications to traffic.
- **ConfigMaps**: For managing configuration files.
- **Secrets**: For managing sensitive information.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine or directly into your cloud environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ayodejiola/kuber.git
cd kuber
```

### Deploy a Resource

To deploy a resource to your Kubernetes cluster, use `kubectl apply`. For example, to deploy a sample application:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployments/sample-app.yaml
```

### Access the Service

If the service is exposed via a LoadBalancer (and you're on a cloud provider that supports it), you can find the external IP using:

```bash
kubectl get services
```

This will list all the services and their details, including any external IPs assigned to them.
